# Bempedoic-Acid-Effect-on-Mortality-in-Primary-and-Secondary-Prevention
This repository contains the code related to an analysis of Bempedoic Acid's effects on mortality in the primary and secondary prevention settings

The analysis was conducted using R, version 4.2.0. The "Bayesian_Re-analysis.R" file contains the code needed to reconstruct the data, choose vague priors, and run the analysis.
The two other files ("Plot (ACM).R" and "Plot (CVM).R") contain the data needed to plot the posterior distributions for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality respectively.
